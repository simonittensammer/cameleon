The school provides teachers and students with a Robolab. +
The Robolab is a place where students can experiment and work on their projects.

== Tasks

Display the surveillance streams on a website. +
Record whenever someone enters or leaves the Robolab. +
Notify the owner whenever someone enters. +
Let the user customize their surveillance streams. +
Combine all of the above in one web application.

== Goals

Make it easier and less time consuming to supervise the Robolab.

== Next steps

Implement motion detection. +
Let the user customize their streams by adding text, images and other special objects like timestamps. +
Add a database to the server which persists streams and the users customization.
