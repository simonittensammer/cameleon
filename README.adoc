=== Description

CAMeleon is a easy-to-use surveillance system for ip-cameras, complete with motion detection, customizable overlays and automatic notifications. It lets you connect devices and video streams via their url and allowes you to view and manage them on a neat user interface.

=== Runing the application

==== *Mongo*
Start an instance of mongoDB. 

==== *Node*

Note: you need to create a folder called 'surveillance-images' in the webapp folder.
This is a bug that will be fixed in time.

[source, bash]
----
npm install
npm start
----

This process may take a few minutes. Afterwards you can reach the CAMeleon app under localhost:3000

==== *on Windows*
You might run into issues trying to install opencv on windows. If this is the case make sure to install https://cmake.org/[cmake] on your system and run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
npm install --global windows-build-tools@4.0.0
----
