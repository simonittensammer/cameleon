= Errors when trying to set up cameleon on Raspberry Pi

=== Raspbian
```
MongoError: Server at localhost:27017 reports wire version 0, but this version of Node.js Driver requires at least 2
```

This error can only be fixed by using a newer version of MongoDB, as seen on this table:
https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/driver-compatibility-reference#node-js-driver-compatibility

Unfortunately the newest version Raspbian supports is MongoDB 2.4, but for the NodeJS Server you need at least MongoDB 4.2.

=== Ubuntu Mate 18.04.4 LTS 32bit

Because of this error we tried to set the project up on Ubuntu Mate 32bit. 
But the 32bit does not support MongoDB at all.
```
Package 'mongodb' has no installation candidate
```

=== Ubuntu Mate 18.04.4 LTS 64bit

The MongoDB Server correctly runns on the Raspberry Pi. 
The Problem on this verion is that the command ```npm install``` always gets stuck.
